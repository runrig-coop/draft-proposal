# Runrig: A Communal Platform for Food & Data Sovereignty
___Locally. Regionally. Globally.___

This is a draft proposal for a communal technology platform and _libre_ software project, tentatively named [Runrig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_rig), with the aim of achieving collective sovereignty over our food, the labor that raises it, the land and living things that support it, and the data connecting it all. It is not intended as a technological solution to a political problem, if such a thing even exists. Rather it is a matter of intentional design, and a moral choice to use technology as befits our political will.
