# Runrig: A Communal Platform for Food & Data Sovereignty
This is a draft proposal for a communal technology platform and _libre_ software project, tentatively named [Runrig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_rig), with the aim of achieving collective sovereignty over our food, as well as the labor that raises it, the land and living things that support it, and the data connecting it all.

_Locally. Regionally. Globally._
