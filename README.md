# Runrig: A Communal Platform for Food & Data Sovereignty
___Locally. Regionally. Globally.___

Runrig[^wiki] is a communal farming platform, a _libre_ software project and a
method of socio-ecological design. It aims for collective sovereignty over not
just our food, but also the labor that raises it, the land and living things
that support it, and the data connecting connecting it all.
