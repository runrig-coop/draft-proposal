## Intellectual Usufruct Rights
There is prevalent yet false impression about data, that it is a form of intellectual property, and that ownership or certain legal entitlements pertain to data the same way they do to creative works, software and real property. Feist v Rural Telephone, GDPR, etc, etc.

...like collective land management, but for network infrastructure and compute resources; or water rights, but for the flow of data; _ejidos electrÃ³nicos_.

## Standards and Tools
We've come to believe what we're told about data standards and shared
ontologies: that they are great in theory, but in the real world things are too
complex and you either end up having a standard that's too specific and
opinionated that it doesn't work for everyone, or too broad and generalized that
it's just not very useful. The Semantic Web itself has endured a great deal of
criticism along these lines over it's 20-year history.

But the unspoken assumption here is that those standards have to survive "trial
by market", where the kind of close coordination required to produce and
maintain a practicable, living standard is all but prohibited by the
profit-seeking, competitive demands of the market. Even as proprietary software
giants like Microsoft and Oracle become cozier with open source technologies and
a general appreciation of the "commons" pervades the industry, control of the
actual data and services generated by those open source tools remains heavily
restricted and privatized. After all, without the privatized control of some
utility or the enclosure of some asset, where would the capital accumulation
come from?

Attempts to take back ownership and control of "Software-as-a-Service" have
largely struggled, I would argue, because we've sought too narrowly to
redistribute those rights piecemeal to individual users, rather than seeking
_common ownership_. Certainly, there are great benefits to individual control in
many contexts, but we handicap our projects by limiting ourselves to those
alternatives exclusively. Taken to the extreme, this would necessitate everyone
have their own server rack in the garage (or at least a Raspberry Pi in the
closet), each of us rolling our own servers independently from one another. 

My fear, however, is that if we're too predisposed to self-hosting, we will
needlessly alienate people who may not want to use a particular piece of
software or hardware, but may wish to participate in the social and economic
activities that such software and hardware facilitate. We would do well to
regard Ivan Illich's criteria for "convivial" tools:

> Tools foster conviviality to the extent to which they can be easily used, by
> anybody, as often or as seldom as desired, for the accomplishment of a purpose
> chosen by the user. The use of such tools by one person does not restrain
> another from using them equally. They do not require previous certification of
> the user. Their existence does not impose any obligation to use them. They
> allow the user to express his meaning in action. (22)

While promising new paradigms like software "appliances"[^RedHat] might
eventually offer the option of plug-and-play personal servers, achieving both
autonomous _and ubiquitous_ computing in the same stroke, they would still leave
critical issues unaddressed. The data and computing capabilities of several
billion humans are today at the whim of just a few dozen technocratic
billionaires. Any serious challenge to these proprietary platforms, and all the
coercive force at their disposal, must come from a base of organized,
community-driven political power, built around shared resources. Now is not the
time to retreat into isolation, each of us behind our own firewall.

Common ownership of our platforms is a far more effective means towards that
end, but also an end in itself...
