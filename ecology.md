## Intellectual Usufruct Rights
There is prevalent yet false impression about data, that it is a form of intellectual property, and that ownership or certain legal entitlements pertain to data the same way they do to creative works, software and real property. Feist v Rural Telephone, GDPR, etc, etc.

...like collective land management, but for network infrastructure and compute resources; or water rights, but for the flow of data; _ejidos electr√≥nicos_.
