# Runrig
:::warning Draft Note
This is a new landing page to eventually replace the README page. Layout, styles and content are still in a very early stage of draft, but the general outline and some key language has been established.
:::

Runrig is a communal technology platform, a _libre_ software project and a
method of socio-ecological design. It aims for the collective sovereignty over
not just our food, but also the labor that raises it, the land and living things
that support it, and the data connecting it all.

___Locally. Regionally. Globally.___

<!-- SECTION 2 -->
## More than just a software commons
Free & open source software is a vital commons in today's digital world. It is, however, a commons of _information only_ â€” it is a starting point, not the destination. Real autonomy requires control of the underlying infrastructure, something beyond the capacity of most individuals. Runrig is a plan for the collective ownership of the system as a whole, because no software user is free until all users are free.



<!-- SECTION 3 -->
## Autonomy by design
Three functional layers:

1. A single, collectively owned data storage provider.
2. Many federated cooperative service platforms.
3. Local-first and self-hosted applications (optional).

:::warning TODO
Add more explanation and a stack diagram of the 3 layers, like this one from the OpenStack website:

<!-- SECTION 4 -->
## Ecology over architecture
The evolution of a software system is only one factor in the evolution of the broader social and natural systems in which it is embedded. Accordingly, Runrig emphasizes ecology, dialogue and free play over any specific technological architecture. Rather than creating an independent, greenfield alternative to the software platforms already available today, we seek out targeted interventions that can multiply the impact of those existing tools, while laying the groundwork for more resilient infrastructure in the future. Runrig aims to be the mortar joining these technological building blocks together, while adding to the overall strength and definition to the greater superstructure.
