# Runrig: A Communal Platform for Food & Data Sovereignty
___Locally. Regionally. Globally.___

Runrig[^wiki] is a _libre_ software project, a communal technology platform and
a plan for socio-ecological design. It aims to achieve collective sovereignty
over not just our food, but also the labor that raises it, the land and living
things that support it, and the data connecting it all. It is not intended as a
purely technological solution to a political problem, if such a thing even
exists; rather, it proposes a method for intentional design that can realize our
political will, while affirming our moral obligation to adopt technologies that
are appropriate, just, and that advance the well-being of all.

_NOTE: This plan is currently in draft._
