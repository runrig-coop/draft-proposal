# Get involved
Runrig is still in the early stages of organizing, but we invite constructive
feedback and other support. For now, you can [email Jamie] with inquiries or suggestions.

We're actively seeking partnerships and collaborations with similarly aligned
organizations, and very soon hope to begin recruiting farmers, activists, tech
workers and other individuals as coop members. Over the coming months, we will
be hosting open design calls and other events, and will post the calendar and
other updates once available. Sign up below if you wish to be notified by email.
