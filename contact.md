# Get involved
:::warning DRAFT NOTE

This plan is currently in draft. I'm sharing it for the purpose of gathering feedback and, I hope, a few collaborators as well. Please feel free to share with anyone who might take an interest, but please note that it isn't ready for a general audience just yet. At least, not until others have an opportunity to contribute and fix all the stuff I've surely gotten wrong! To get involved, [email me] or checkout the main [document repository].
