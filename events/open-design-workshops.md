<!-- OLD WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION & TIME TABLE

The Open Design Workshops are the main venue where both the Runrig community and
its core technologies are being constructed. Three 1-hour workshops are held
each month at varied times of day and days of the week to provide more
opportunities to participate for people coming from different timezones or who
have a recurring obligation that might conflict with a single time and day of
the week.

| N<sup>th</sup> Day of the Month | Office Hours  | Workshop     |
| :------------------------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| First Friday                    | 7:30 - 8am ET | 8am - 9am ET |
| Second Sunday                   | 1:30 - 2pm ET | 2pm - 3pm ET |
| Third Thursday                  | 5:30 - 6pm ET | 6pm - 7pm ET |

We'll try to keep a list of specific dates & times for the next few upcoming
events posted [above](#event-schedule).

Each workshop session will also be live-streamed and posted afterwards to the
[Runrig YouTube Channel] so people can watch later if they miss it or want to
catch up.

The agenda for each session will be begin with a quick round of check-ins and a
recap on whichever project we're working on (recent progress, general aims,
etc), and what we hope to achieve in that session. We'll also leave time at the
end for a brief review of progress and action items, confirm the agenda for the
following week, then check-out. The bulk of the session will tend to be focused
and determined by the specific project's goals, with a more detailed agenda we
can decide on collaboratively. This is why we're setting aside "office hours"
where people can join half an hour early for more informal chat and Q&A.
