## User Journeys
Based on their different needs and business models, it may be helpful to think about the different user stories for Jess Hudson and Tianna Kennedy, as well as the people they need to communicate with.

In Jess's case, those are farmers in RGO, who have the crop plan she created and sent to them, and who also need to get a survey from her at some point to fill out and send back to her securely. On the ordering side, most customers will do so up front before crops are even planted, and so communication with them is probably more direct and consolidated. In general, it will be a more tightly coordinated system, with considerably more attention given to the process of planning and making sure everything adheres to that predetermined plan, rather than adapting the plan as the season progresses.

In Tianna's case, the people she's communicating with are farmers in 607 CSA, who may have many other business interests and distribution outlets. They will have a broader production schedule and crop plan, which they design and of which 607 is only one component. They will want to opt-in to sell their products at different times of year, with varying degrees of lead-time as supply and demand ebb and flow. For these reasons, it will need to be a substantially more flexible system, characterized by a high degree of responsiveness and adaptability as needs and capacities fluctuate over time. And in that respect, it's primary function will be to track what is actually sold and shipped, when and where, rather than monitoring the progress of a predetermined plan. She is also taking orders on more of a rolling basis, with individual consumers even ordering a la carte, so the ordering system needs to be more flexible too.

### Single Sign-On
The basic registration, authentication and authorization processes will be of paramount interest to these work flows: What does the login/sign-up screen look like? Is there a single URL they go to? How is it different for Jess and Tianna versus the farmers and customers they're working with? How does it connect with whatever sales platform(s) the customers use? How do we balance the need to maintain each user's data sovereignty while also providing a seamless, simple and secure user experience?

These authentication and security concerns will be especially insightful while making decisions about the hosting architecture and data storage.
